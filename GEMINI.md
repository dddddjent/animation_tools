## Rules

- You should add as less comment as possible (but a little comment for the functions/classes are welcome)
- Don't change what I changed after your modfications. If you found anything changed after the last chat, it's what I did. Build on top of it.

## Project Overview

This project is a collection of tools for processing and retargeting BVH and FBX animation files. The primary goal is to provide a set of utilities for manipulating animation data, such as converting between formats, cleaning up noisy data, and retargeting animations to different skeletons.
